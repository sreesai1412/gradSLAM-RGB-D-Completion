# gradSLAM-RGB-D-Completion

gradSLAM is a fully differentiable dense SLAM framework, i.e., it allows for gradient flow from the outputs of an RGB-D SLAM system (trajectory, 3D map of the environment) all the way through to its inputs (color and depth images). In this project, we will use this capability to recover missing color and depth observations from an image sequence.
